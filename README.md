Small React project inspired by ["Green Forest" article](http://greenforest.com.ua/journal/read/must-know-prepositions-3). 

Tell me, do you listen to music every day? 
Why can’t I say “listen music” or “listen at music” or “listen on music”? Because we say “listen to”. But why? – you will ask me. Because there are some prepositions that we simply must know.
Lets check your grammar skills! Go to quiz [here](https://khrystyna.github.io/must-known-prepositions/)!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
